## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Typescript
- ContextAPI \_ useReducer
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- At first I had done Rock-Paper-Scissors, but wanted to give some challange so i went for bonus challange.
- It was not that hard to extent the logic.
- Right now logic is kind of simple but will think of better way and update the logic in future.
- Used **ContextAPI** with **useReducer** which made component clean and short.

### Continued development

- I will look t develop game with more complex logic.
